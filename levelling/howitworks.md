BeeMod levelling works quite easily.

Everytime a user sends a message in a server with BeeMod in, the level.json file is updated, storing the xp, level and id of the user. It is also server-specific.

b!rank, b!lvl and b!level all do the same thing, showing the users rank in the server and how much XP they have. It is shown in a embed like so:

The more a user levels up the more xp a user needs to gain another level
